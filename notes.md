- **SO**... I am thinking about a aptt app, implemented in ci/cd to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities, especially for golang for now, later want to do python and java / C#
    1. first thing I would like I suppose is to indentify the files, scan them against some rules and exploitation and then provide reports and feedback
