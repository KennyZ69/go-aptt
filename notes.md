- **SO**... I am thinking about a aptt app, implemented in ci/cd to scan the codebase for vulnerabilities, especially for golang for now, later want to do python and java / C#
    1. first thing I would like I suppose is to indentify the files, scan them against some rules and exploitation and then provide reports and feedback
   
- I mean I want this to be instalable using command line so install it using curl or something
- And I want this to when ran spin up the container and the sandbox enviroment in the virtual machine not on the clients machine (that should probably work with the ci/cd tools as github actions or what)
