#GoApt

This is a project in development with lots of mistakes probably and unfinished things.
If you want to know what and how to run, install the **goapt** binary and run ./goapt --help

##What things I am currently working on?
- Network scan, find active machines, open ports, running services and analyze...
- The command line interface
- Ways of installation
- Set up on a remote machine for simulating attacks

Please excuse possible mistakes made anywhere in the codebase. Feedback would be highly appreciated.
